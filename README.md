Program Description
The "Balloon Burst Game" is an entertaining and participatory game that evaluates players' aim and response times. Players engage with moving objects (balloons) that bounce around the screen in different sizes and colors. To "burst" these targets—which award points for each burst balloon—players must click on them. The three difficulty settings in the game—easy, medium, and hard—affect the balloons' speed and the player's initial life count. Players can extend their time limit in this time-limited game by striking targets. The game ends when all lives are lost or time runs out, displaying the player's score.
